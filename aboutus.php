                <p>We are creating another box (div) named as “slider”. As the name suggests, this will be the box that will actually slide (left and right) inside the “visible-area” div. Since this box will slide (left and right) inside the “visible-area” div, hence its pretty obvious that the width of this box will be more than its parent div. We have not defined the width of this box in main.css file, because its width will be calculated dynamically using jQuery (which we will see later). </p>
